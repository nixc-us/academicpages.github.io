#### A work in progress

This portfolio is still a WIP.  When curating a public persona image I like to be respectful of your time and attention, so I like to be brief but informative.  In this, I find myself as most people making sure that I have things the way I feel best represents me.  For now, this results in this relatively recently published portfolio page is incomplete.  

However, if you feel like you still want to peruse what I've felt is essential thus far I encourage you to click around.
