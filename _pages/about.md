## About Colin_

I've run 2 successful niche market businesses in the last decade of my life.  One project being a sole proprietorship consulting company named Nixium[Sold] and the other a Game Based Learning content distribution and development company named Athion.net[Sold].

I've worked with Multi-Creator Networks [MCN's] from YouTube such as [TheCreatureHub](https://www.youtube.com/user/thecreaturehub) and other individual YouTubers such as [Steven Suptic](linkgoeshere) formerly known as [mlgHwnT](youtube channel missing) and [Eddie Cardona Jr aka xXSlyFoxHoundXx](https://www.youtube.com/user/xXSlyFoxHoundXx) one of my favorite people to work with in the YouTube ecosystem.
