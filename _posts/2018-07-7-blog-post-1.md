On Athion my former company we would work on many things that would help us build insights into the performance of our educational system.  We would provide free training by volunteer guidance and peer review of tools methods and concepts used.  

We would manage to do this using an automated review system we wrote in house to review your works.  Our goal was essentially to be sure that we would guide you to learn and acquire the tools you would need in order to express what was in your mind using the medium provided (Minecraft).

One of the things that helped us understand the performance of our review staff and our students.  So I contacted a good friend of mine who is a web designer by profession and we spec'd out [https://athion.net/reviewStats/](https://archive.fo/icEUj)

The concept was that we would be able to see if there were any inconsistencies in the process by creating data filters and visuals on our years of metrics collected.
