I'd love for this to exist.

```
Usage of confman:
confman
-k    --key, can be passed any string and it will look for any key in a configuration file and then replace whatever its value is with -v
-v    --value, can be passed any string and it will replace any value that preexists in it's place.  If there is more than one value you can specify -va to replace all instances matching the key or -v1 to match the first only, the number can be incremented to any positive integer.  Otherwise you can try using -l or --list to display confman's interpretation of the configuration files dictionaries matching your --key.
-l    --list, this can display via stdout what your --key string returns in its entirety so you can target multiple result key/value pairs with more precision.
-f    --format, should not be required as we can read the file extension but in case the file has a strange extension or none at all you can specify one with -f, for example confman -f YAML -k KEY -v VALUE
```
