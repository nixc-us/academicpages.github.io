# Github Ninja

If you like committing to git a lot and want a profile for home and a profile for work let me tell you, this article is for you. Commit as one and push with another.

What you're going to want to do is first get 2 of the following:
* 2 high quality SSH keys
* 2 GitHub/GitLab accounts
* 2 Repositories with different destinations you'd like them sent to.

## Step 1: SSH Keys
Generate a nice high quality SSH key.  Then do it twice.  Name them like I suggest or name them something you'll remember if you're feeling creative or like my convention is less exciting to you. Make sure that you copy the whole string and replace CHANGEME with your github username and not your github email address.

```
USER1=CHANGEME && ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "$(whoami)"@${HOSTNAME:-$HOST} -q -f ~/.ssh/github-com-${USER1:-username1}-ed25519 -N "" && cat ~/.ssh/github-com-${USER1:-username1}-ed25519.pub
```

Then you can run create a second one.
```
USER2=CHANGEME && ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "$(whoami)"@${HOSTNAME:-$HOST} -q -f ~/.ssh/github-com-${USER2:-username2}-ed25519 -N "" && cat ~/.ssh/github-com-${USER2:-username2}-ed25519.pub
```

## Step 2: SSH Identities
Once you've generated your SSH keys you need to tell your computer about them.
You can use your favorite editor or just whatever one your system's got installed using the following.

```
$EDITOR ~/.ssh/config
```

You may have things in this file already if you do feel free to append an edited version of the following into it `OR` just create this file with an edited version of the following.  

```
Host github.com-USER1
        HostName github.com
        User USER1
        IdentityFile /Users/$(whoami)/.ssh/github-com-USER1-ed25519
Host github.com-USER2
        HostName github.com
        User USER2
        IdentityFile /Users/$(whoami)/.ssh/github-com-USER2-ed25519
```

## Step 3: SSH aliases
You can get the hang of replacing the variables here on out I'm sure so I'll just say copy this stuff and replace the strings.  This will create git aliases for swapping identities for committing.
```
git config --global alias.workprofile 'config user.email "USER1@EXAMPLE.COM"'
git config --global alias.workprofile 'config user.name "USER1"'
git config --global alias.personalprofile 'config user.email "USER2@EXAMPLE.COM"'
git config --global alias.personalprofile 'config user.name "USER2"'
```
You can now switch aliases by running the following before committing and pushing code.
```
git personalprofile
git workprofile
```
## Step 4: Git origin update
When you're setting your repositories `git origin` you'll need to set it related to the `Host` that you defined in your `~/.ssh/config` this will let git/ssh know what key to use when you push.

## Step 5: Pubkeys to correct accounts
Make sure that your pubkeys are associated with the correct accounts.

Follow the usual steps here to do this.  I might upload instructions about this in the future if you can't find the official guide on how to do this on GitHub or GitLab and I learn to read minds over the internet.

## Step 6: git config user.email|name
Now if you run the following commands inside of each repository that you plan to push from locally to one of these wonderful free services like Git[Hub|Lab] you can set local config options that are local to the specific repository.

You'll need to run the following from inside of the git repository itself for each repository you commit to.

```
git config user.name 'USER1'
git config user.email 'USER1@EXAMPLE.COM'
```
